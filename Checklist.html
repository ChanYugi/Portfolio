            The focus of this project is more so on the unit testing and integration testing of the 
            different checklist app components and less on the application itself. The idea is to 
            familiarize myself with various frameworks and tools that are commonly used throughout the 
            industry by actually using them!

            The checklist app follows a fairly simple tutorial that outlines the different componenets that 
            help to build the application. Using Angular, the application is broken down into two components: the 
            individual checklist entries and the checklist itself. The checklist acts as a housing to contain 
            all the different checklist entries. Each component have their own set of methods and functions that 
            allow the system to work as a cohesive unit.
