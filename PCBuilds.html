            This build definitely focuses on both function and form... perhaps maybe a 
            larger emphasis on the form. Everything on this build had RGB: from the GPU 
            to the RAM, even down to the cables! Performance-wise, it will be able to 
            handle any title or application at high resolutions and frame rates with 
            minimal bottlenecking. Although the 64GB of RAM may seem a bit overkill, 
            the client will also be using it as a work station for video and photo 
            editing as well.

            This build is more budget friendly, but it will still run most applications and gaming titles 
            fairly well. The PSU was selected based on the criteria that this PC will recieve upgrades in 
            the future, especially in the CPU department.
