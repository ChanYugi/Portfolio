            This project focuses on learning about building a simple embedded system and understanding how to bring 
            projects to life with a Nucleo STM32 microcontroller. 
            As a group, we were working with fairly old hardware, only having a motor shield for the microcontroller, 
            a borrowed power supply, a few stepper motors, and a few finicky switches/potentiometers, but we made it 
            work. That's part of the experience! The mechanical setup of the project was primarily borrowed from the 
            university, giving us more freedom to learn about integrating an embedded systems from a controls and 
            hardware perspective.

        <h2 class="ProjectSubTitle">Microcontoller Implementation</h2>
        <img src="MachineProject/MachinePhoto.jpg" height="400px" width="600px">
        <p class="ProjectContent">
            The goal of this project was to implement a microcontoller to (control) the machine to move anywhere along 
            a 2D-plane. As failsafes, the switches were used to set the physical boundaries of the motor and board. It 
            was decided that this would be a better implementation than using the stepper motor to calculate the 
            location as offsets accumulated over time may be difficult to account for. The potentiometer would be used 
            to control the speed and direction along one axis while another switch would be used to control the direction.
            This was an intentional design choice as it can be difficult to safely operate the motors with multiple 
            potentiometers.
            <br> <br>

            The first step was to test the hardware, making sure everything works to some degree. Generally, this is a 
            good idea to avoid any headaches and unexpected behaviours later on. This was accomplished by using an 
            oscilloscope, a wave generator, and a multimeter. Then we proceeded with figuring out the interrupts and 
            interrupt handler for the step motors. To do this, we connected a GPIO pin to the 3.3 volt pin with a 
            normally-closed switch and configured it as a pull-down resistor. Subsequently, when the switch breaks the 
            circuit, it's programmed to fire an interrupt signal to the interrupt handler. The handler will then perform 
            the corresponding executable to drive an LED. Ultimately, this test helps to provide the framework for how 
            the limit switch interrupts will work; when a switch is triggered, fire off the interrupt.

        <h2 class="ProjectSubTitle">Motor Characterization</h2>
        <img src="MachineProject/MotorSpeedPhoto.jpg" height="350px" width="600px">
        <p class="ProjectContent">
            The 3.3 volt pin on the microcontroller is connected to a potentiometer and then to the input pin for setting 
            the speed. With the step motors, an integer can be set through the microcontoller to control the speed. The 
            issue with this is that this value is arbitrary to us until we can characterize and map the integer value to 
            a speed. Additionally, it is important to also find the integer associated with the maximum speed as this 
            information allows us to map the speed of the motor to the input voltage range. To characterize the motors, we 
            we programmed it to move along one axis while incrementing the arbitrary value with each run. The speed of each 
            value was calculate by taking the time to cross the known distance, and this was plotted in excel to determine 
            the linearity of the motor speeds as well as the maximum speed.

        <h2 class="ProjectSubTitle">Machine Logic and Wiring</h2>

        <p class="ProjectContent">
            The hardware was configured such that the limit switches and the potentiometer used the 3.3 volt pin as the high 
            voltage via a breadboard. Similarly, the ground pin was also connected to the breadboard for the pins and 
            potentiometer. The microcontroller would be powered through our laptops while the stepper motors themselves use a 
            an external power supply.   
            <br><br>
            In the early stages of development, the team felt it was most important to implement the limit switches and 
            build around the constraints. This would ultimately eliminate a layer of variability in the later stages. 
            The logic implemented for the limit switches is when an if an interrupt fires, the motors would stop immediately 
            then move back a set number of steps. This executable effectively prevents the machine from surpassing the 
            physical bounds and from causing damage to the stepper motors. 
            <br><br>
            Next, we moved towards determining how the machine's movement will be controlled. Since the motor behaviour was 
            previously characterized, we used the built-in ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) to translate voltage readings 
            from the potentiometer to an 8 bit digital value. This will provide a range of values between 0 to 255 and is then 
            mapped to a range of stepper motor inputs. The median voltage value of the potentiometer was programmed to 
            correspond to a rest state and rotating the knob clockwise or counter-clockwise will actuate the motors forwards 
            or backwards.
            <br><br>
            As only one potentiometer is used to control the motion of the machine, a switch was implemented to pivot between 
            the different axes along the plane. 
            The direction switch takes the limit switch implementation and modifies it to
            actuate different motors instead.
