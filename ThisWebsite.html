            Hi! Here, I can explain a little bit more about this website, as well as some of the 
            processes and problems I had to solve along the way.
        </div>

        <img src="WebProject/GoogleChromePhoto.jpg" height="350px" width="500px">

        <div class="ProjectContent">
            Originally, when I wanted to build my own website, I stated looking for inspiration on the 
            general experience or feeling that it gives off when someone browses through it. I looked 
            at some student examples, a few portfolios, but I took a lot of inspiration from the Google
            Chrome download page. Yes... the download page.
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="ProjectSubTitle">Dynamic Background</div>
        <img src="WebProject/DynamicBackgroundProjectPhoto.jpg" height="350px" width="600px">
        <div class="ProjectContent">
            One feature that I wanted to have was a dynamic background that would change in colour as 
            the user scrolls to different sections. This was one of the first features that I tackled 
            working on this project, and proved to be a great opportunity to learn more about DOM 
            manipulation. 
            <br> <br>
            Using the built-in methods and a few conditional statements, I was able to lay down the 
            foundation for how the logic of the script works. I obtained the window height and 
            compared it with the element's height to check if a background change was necessary. 
            This is where I learned about the DOMContentLoaded event, and how this may affect scripts 
            if not properly checked (I didn't at first). Since I didn't wrap my scripts with this 
            event listener, they did not load properly and did not function as intended. This was 
            eventually rectified and now works properly with the right event listener! 
            <br> <br>

            This next major issue was debouncing this eventlistener. Since this script uses a scroll 
            event listener, it runs a check with every scroll. This is unnecessary for something so 
            trivial, so it was crucial to debounce this in order to greatly improve resouce management. 
            This was implemented using various timers that would ensure executables would not run 
            unless the scrolling has stopped for a short time. 
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="ProjectSubTitle">Navigation</div>
        <img src="WebProject/ButtonScrollProjectPhoto.jpg" height="325px" width="600px">
        <div class="ProjectContent">
            I noticed a fair number of student examples and professional portfolios were missing 
            navigation features, making it difficult to reach different pages. So, I decided to make 
            this aspect a main feature within my website. 
            <br> <br>
            Using Chrome as a reference point, I implemented a hidden sticky banner with navigation 
            buttons that appears when scrolling down. This was done with the built-in methods to find 
            the height of the viewport and a few conditional statements to trigger the corresponding 
            executables to make the banner visable.
            <br> <br>

            The navigation button scripts posed their own small issues. I created a modular scroll 
            function that finds the HTML element ID, and scrolls it into view. However, the issue 
            is that I specifically wanted the viewport to be at a certain height relative to the 
            section. The built-in scroll methods don't currently have an option for this, so it 
            required some extra thought and care to store the offset height and to scroll that 
            element's offset positon.
            <br> <br>

            The last feature that I felt was crucical is the return or home button. I found that many 
            personal websites often had no way to navigate back to the main page or to other sections. 
            So, this addition felt more necessary than others.
